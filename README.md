# StepOverGap_FOV
 ## Goal
 Manipulate Field of View (Comparing Narrow FOV - 50°Horizontal x 23°Vertical and Wide FOV - Natural HTC Vive Pro FOV) to explore how it affect human affordance judgement when crossing a gap
 
 ## Protocol
 96 trials in total
 
 4 conditions : 2FOV (Wide/Narrow) x 2Directions(0°/90°)
 
 In each condition, 24 trials with gap changing in range from 0.45 to 1.50 with 0.15 increments (for a total of 8 gaps, 3x each, in random order)
 
 ## How to run
To run this project, you can choose "Windows Build" or "Mac Build" according to your OS. You need a Vive HMD and one controller.

Under Project file, you can find the source code. This project is created using Unity 2019.2.21f1. Any Unity 2019.2.x should work fine with this project. 
Scenes are in StepOverGap_FOV/Project/FOV_HDRP/Assets/MyScenes. StartScene and VRScene are main scenes for recording subject's information and running the experiment. TestFOV is for getting the parameters of the simulated FOV using the virtual mapping environment as frame of reference.
