# StepOverGap_FOV
 ## Goal
 Manipulate FOV (simulate HoloLens FOV in VR) to explore how it affect human affordance judgement when crossing a gap

 4 conditions : 2FOV (Natural/HoloLens) x 2Directions
 In each condition, 24 trials with gap changing from 0.45 to 1.50 with 0.15 increments (for a total of 8 gaps, 3x each)
